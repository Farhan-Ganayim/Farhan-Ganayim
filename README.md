### Hi, I'm Farhan Ganayim â€” Full-Stack & Frontend Developer ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a passionate Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience building responsive, user-friendly web applications using **JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB**.  
Graduated from an intensive Full-Stack Development bootcamp at **Coding Academy by MisterBit**, designed by the former Head of Training of the IDFâ€™s elite Mamram unit.  

âš¡ During the program, I worked on **real-world, team-based projects** with weekly code reviews, Agile methodology, and modern best practices.  
ðŸš€ Some of my projects include a **freelance services platform**, an **email & notes app**, and collaborative **CRUD systems**.  

ðŸ’¡ I love clean code, great UI/UX, and problem-solving. Always open to learning, collaborating, and sharing ideas!
